My dad claimed that canny Rams players of the past would lure unsuspecting opponents into the deepest mud knowing they‚Äôd get stuck.‚Äù I love that. Why does nobody coach *that* anymore? This is much more like it from Danny Michaux: ‚ÄúAs a Spurs supporter, beating City on this lame excuse of a pitch would be hilarious. Imagine Vincent Kompany slowly trudging off at the final whistle and getting caught in a boggy section, Pep‚Äôs fury in the post-match interview, the endless impotent bashing of keyboards on social media sites and comment sections across the nation and beyond calling for Spurs to be stripped of their points and fined. Doesn‚Äôt it fill your heart with hope that there is some magic left in the game? ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to get pumped though.‚Äù It‚Äôd rival Darren Bent and the beach ball. On to some football and here‚Äôs Ed Aarons on Maurico Pochettino‚Äôs sense of discontentment. Been a funny start to the season for them, hasn‚Äôt it? As mentioned in the piece, their league form is fine ‚Äì but only a few weeks ago we were worrying about them losing games hand over fist and being in a mini crisis. The Champions League campaign has certainly been unsatisfactory so far, and Pochettino‚Äôs biggest annoyance is clearly that the stadium business hasn‚Äôt been put to bed ‚Äì thus continuing to weigh Spurs down. They‚Äôre churning results out without quite looking at their best at the moment. Can tonight bring the kind of season-defining performance that might cheer their manager up? ‚ÄúAs a Spurs supporter, I don‚Äôt ever wish to lose points but beating City on this lame excuse of a pitch would make me embarrassed, not elated with joy. A draw would be best,‚Äù writes Kaushik Prasad. Whooooaaaa! Does everything in this ultra-serious Premier League of ours really have to be gleamingly splendrous all the time? I do take the indirect point that Spurs‚Äô stadium situation has gone/is going very badly and that this is an unfortunate consequence of that. I‚Äôll talk about some actual football in a bit but look what we did for you back in 2016! A Joy of Six: Sporting Pitch Fiascos! Will tonight make seven? Interesting snippet from the wires, reporting that the match officials have been doing their due diligence on the surface: Parts of the pitch are lush and green, but there are large areas of worn brown turf, especially on each touchline, while the NFL logo is still visible in the centre circle. Referee Kevin Friend and his fellow match officials walked around the pitch at around 6pm with a ball testing to see how it rolls. ‚ÄúWembley has come a long way from 1970 when domesticated equines tore up the pitch before the FA Cup final with the Horse of the Year Show,‚Äù notes Justin Kavanagh. ‚ÄúThese days its Jaguars from Jacksonville and Philadelphian Eagles ruining the footie! Mind you, the Jaguars seemed to be only interested in prowling London‚Äôs nightclubs (running up a bar bill of $64,000, according to a Philly news report) and the droppings of eagles don‚Äôt seem too big a problem at Selhurst Park.‚Äù Tottenham Hotspur: Lloris, Trippier, Sanchez, Alderweireld, Davies, Dier, Dembele,Sissoko, Lamela, Lucas Moura, Kane. Subs: Son, Winks, Walker-Peters, Alli, Gazzaniga, Eriksen, Aurier. Man City: Ederson, Walker, Stones, Laporte, Mendy, Bernardo Silva, Fernandinho, Silva, Mahrez, Aguero, Sterling. Subs: Kompany, De Bruyne, Sane, Otamendi, Gabriel Jesus, Foden, Muric. Referee: Kevin Friend That‚Äôs interesting ‚Äì Christian Eriksen and Kevin De Bruyne are both on the bench. Both have had their injury troubles. Is that a reaction from both managers to the pitch issue? Either way, it‚Äôs potentially a shame for the spectacle. ‚ÄúFaded American football stripes on a torn-up Wembley turf for a Premier League match?‚Äù observes Peter Oh. ‚ÄúOh the irony! Or should I say, the gridirony?‚Äù The pitch doesn‚Äôt look great, does it, and the NFL logo in the middle tells a few stories. I have a question though. It‚Äôs not exactly going to be a quagmire, and 20 years ago nobody would have batted an eyelid ‚Äì why aren‚Äôt things simply allowed to be a bit rubbish anymore? A Premier League weekend that has, for obvious reasons, been very difficult comes to an end tonight with a fixture that promises plenty of flourishes on the pitch. In fact it‚Äôs funny I mentioned the pitch, isn‚Äôt it, because that‚Äôs stolen many of the headlines before Tottenham‚Äôs keenly awaited match against Manchester City. Wembley‚Äôs surface has come off decidedly second-best to yesterdays NFL game and hands are being wrung about just how technical Mauricio Pochettino and Pep Guardiola‚Äôs men will be able to get tonight. Are you wringing yours? Does this sort of thing actually worry you? Either way it‚Äôs added another storyline to a match that doesn‚Äôt really need much setting up: if Tottenham, who often do pretty well against Man City, can do something here then you sense we really do have a title race this year. If City cut loose, as they did here in April, you wonder whether they‚Äôre purring towards top gear and ready to pull away again. They‚Äôll go top on goal difference if they win; should Spurs take the points, though, City will drop to fourth and the hosts will go third. Plenty to get our teeth into then. Send me your tweets and emails ‚Äì should be able to get through a fair few before kick-off, which is at 8pm UK time. Not midnight, even if it feels like that since the clocks went back.",

The shake-up means: A bottle of wine goes up by 7p, sparkling wine by 10p. Average pack of 20 cigarettes to rise above ¬£10. Online gambling hit by ¬£1bn taxes over five years. The government‚Äôs decision earlier this year to cut the maximum stake on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) from ¬£100 to ¬£2 triggered an overhaul of gambling tax, due to take effect in October. Lost revenue from the machine gaming duty levied on FOBTs is expected to cost the exchequer ¬£1.15bn over five years, according to Treasury projections. It will make up for the shortfall by increasing the tax on online casino games from 15% to 21%, raising an estimated ¬£1.25bn over the same period. While the tweaks to gambling tax will cancel each other out fiscally, both FOBT campaigners and online gambling companies are likely to be unhappy. Campaigners against FOBTs, who say they are highly addictive, criticised the decision to postpone FOBT curbs until October last year, as revealed by the Guardian last week. Labour‚Äôs deputy leader, Tom Watson, said: ‚ÄúBy rolling back on their promises the government are allowing greed to triumph over good as the bookies trouser an additional ¬£900m in revenue. ‚ÄúThe new secretary of state has let down not only his predecessors who campaigned for urgent change, but all the gambling charities, reformers and addicts who were relying on him not to bow to the will of the Treasury.‚Äù The chancellor surprised the beer and pubs industry by cancelling duty hikes on beer and spirits, which were expected to see a 3.4% rise in line with inflation, but wine duty will continue to rise.

The Wine and Spirit Trade Association said distillers would welcome the cancellation of a rise in spirits duty but said winemakers would be hit with an extra ¬£90m bill. ‚ÄúIt actively undermines a sector that has been hardest hit since the Brexit referendum and will be thoroughly unwelcome for the 33 million consumers of the nation‚Äôs most popular alcoholic drink,‚Äù said the association‚Äôs chief executive, Miles Beale.

Root‚Äôs response to the Broad question was Delphic; it could be interpreted in various ways. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a changing of the guard and I wouldn‚Äôt say he‚Äôs in a weaker position than he has been previously,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe still haven‚Äôt finalised the team. He could still definitely play a massive part within the three-match series and definitely the first game is an option. But we have struggled away from home a number of times now, so we are trying to find a different formula with him or without him. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it weakens him as a player or where his game is going. I think he‚Äôs actually improving all the time and using his experience wisely. His action is as strong as it has ever been but whether we have to find a different formula we‚Äôll just have to wait and see. We have to make a real, clear call on what‚Äôs going to be the best side on a given surface.‚Äù Sir Humphrey would have been proud of Root‚Äôs perambulation. A guess is that Broad is likely to be left out, which probably means he will produce a four for 10 spell over the next few days. The other debate centres on the identity of the opening batsmen. Keaton Jennings is the only one in the squad who has opened regularly for England recently, yet there remains a good argument he should give way to Rory Burns and Joe Denly with the possibility of Moeen Ali continuing at No 3. In this instance runs over the next few days for any of the three new(ish) boys will be significant. So Root has plenty to ponder though his concerns are pinpricks compared with the recent experiences of the former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga, who ‚Äúfeared for his life‚Äù at the weekend. Until last Friday Ranatunga was a government minister; then one person was killed by his security detail amid unrest outside his former office as Ranatunga collected some of his personal effects. He has since been arrested. The political situation is volatile with the prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, sacked by the president and replaced by a former president Mahinda Rajapaksa. The England and Wales Cricket Board is continuing with its preparations for the series as planned but said: ‚ÄúWe are aware of the developments and are in constant contact with the British High Commission. We are exercising vigilance and avoiding all demonstrations or large political gatherings.‚Äù",

By injecting ¬£1.7bn into work allowances, the chancellor reversed much of the cut to universal credit made by his predecessor, George Osborne, in 2015 and suggested ministers were fully committed to the much-delayed benefits overhaul programme. Hammond‚Äôs cash-for-work allowances may be enough to head off a threatened revolt by Conservative backbenchers concerned that some low-income working families on tax credits would be ¬£200 a month worse off after moving to universal credit. ‚ÄúUniversal credit is here to stay and we are putting in the funding needed to make it a success,‚Äù Hammond told the Commons. He said it was a ‚Äúlong overdue and necessary reform‚Äù of the benefits system that would help drive jobs and growth. Hammond also announced an extra ¬£1bn over five years to provide extra protection for people on tax credits and other benefits who would be moved over to universal credit in the next few years. Details will be announced this year. There will be ‚Äúrun-on‚Äù support from 2020, whereby unemployed claimants will continue to receive existing benefits for two weeks after submitting their universal credit application, in a move aimed at easing the long waiting time for a first payment. Universal credit rolls together six working-age benefits into a single monthly payment, including jobseeker‚Äôs allowance, working tax credits and housing benefits. Work allowances are the amount claimants can earn before benefits start to be withdrawn. Higher work allowances in theory encourage claimants to move into work, or work longer hours. The Resolution Foundation thinktank welcomed the work allowance boost, saying the ¬£1,000 threshold increase would deliver a ¬£630 boost to low-income families, meaning universal credit was now more generous than the benefit system it was replacing.

John McDonnell, Labour‚Äôs shadow chancellor, said: ‚ÄúThe money promised for universal credit is less than a third of the ¬£7bn of social security cuts still to come and today‚Äôs announcement on work allowances reverses just over half the cuts made in 2015.‚Äù Matthew Reed, the chief executive at the Children‚Äôs Society, said: ‚ÄúWhile the government has taken some important steps in the right direction it has still not done enough to address serious problems with universal credit which are causing hardship for many families.‚Äù Alison Garnham, the chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, said: ‚ÄúThe work allowance increase is unequivocally good news for families receiving universal credit but a bigger salvage operation is still needed for the benefit.‚Äù Hammond‚Äôs striking endorsement of universal credit comes after criticism from two previous prime ministers, Sir John Major and Gordon Brown, who said the changes could trigger poll tax-levels of public unpopularity. Labour has called for universal credit to be halted and fixed before the next stage of its rollout, which will lead to 2 million claimants on tax credits and employment and support allowance migrate on to the new system during the next three years. The chancellor has also been under intense pressure from Conservative backbenchers and poverty campaigners to restore the level of work allowances, seen by many as essential if universal credit is to uphold its original aims of incentivising work. Hammond pointedly paid tribute to the political architect of universal credit, the former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith, now a backbench MP, ‚Äúwithout whose tenacity universal credit would never have seen the light‚Äù. Duncan Smith oversaw the introduction of universal credit in the face of opposition from Osborne and a series of implementation disasters. He resigned from the cabinet in 2016 in part over cuts to work allowances the previous autumn. The chancellor‚Äôs announcement on work allowances was welcomed by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which called it ‚Äúan important step forward‚Äù in tackling the rise of in-work poverty that it said would help ease the burden for low-income families.",

Chancellors normally show their mean streak when parliaments are young and squirrel away any available cash so that they can give money away as polling day approaches.</p> <p>Not this time, though. The chancellor was in the position of knowing that public borrowing this year is on course to be ¬£12bn lower than was predicted in the spring ‚Äì an extremely happy outcome given the economy‚Äôs mediocre performance.</p> <p>Less than 18 months into the current parliament, Hammond could have saved his windfall and met his stated aim of balancing the budget by the middle of the next decade. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/29/hammond-claims-hard-work-paid-off-end-of-austerity-in-sight-budget\">Instead he decided to blow the lot ‚Äì in higher spending and an unexpected</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/29/hammond-claims-hard-work-paid-off-end-of-austerity-in-sight-budget\"> income tax cut.</a></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/29/hammond-claims-hard-work-paid-off-end-of-austerity-in-sight-budget\">Hammond says end of austerity is in sight as he boosts spending</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The independent <a href=\"https://obr.uk/overview-october-2018-economic-fiscal-outlook/\">Office for Budget Responsibility </a>(OBR) says the UK will still be in the red by 2023-24, although in reality a great deal depends on the sort of Brexit deal the government secures. Hammond expressed cheerful optimism about the double deal bonus he would get in the event that negotiations end successfully: the end of the uncertainty that has led firms to mothball investment plans will lead to stronger growth, and there will be no need to keep money aside for a no-deal outcome.</p> <p>Even so, the chancellor had to accept that he might be back with another package of measures in the spring if talks between London and Brussels break down over the coming months. In those circumstances, there will be pressure for a significant loosening of fiscal policy and all talk of balancing the budget by the middle of the next decade will go out of the window.</p> <p>The budget was unashamedly political both in its tone and its content. Hammond used every opportunity to take a swing at Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell on the Labour benches and took delight in announcing that there would be no more PFI projects on his watch.</p> <p>There could be only three possible explanations for Hammond‚Äôs approach. One is that he has overnight morphed into a born-again Keynesian and has decided that a bit more growth is the way to lick the public finances back into shape. That seems unlikely.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/29/key-points-from-budget-2018-at-a-glance\">Key points from budget 2018 ‚Äì at a glance</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A second is that the government secretly believes it is heading for a no-deal Brexit, so is giving the economy some padding before expected disruption during 2019. But if that were the case, Hammond would be keeping every bit of ammunition in reserve, not spending it now, so that does not seem all that probable either.</p> <p>That leaves the third and final explanation, which is that the real architect of this budget was Theresa May ‚Äì not Hammond. As the chancellor rather ruefully said, it was the prime minister who announced an extra ¬£84bn over five years for the NHS back in the summer, thus depriving him of a rabbit to pull out of the hat.</p> <p>What‚Äôs more, May then went further in her party conference speech and said that the public needed to know that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/03/theresa-may-conference-speech-ambasts-labour-as-she-calls-for-tory-unity\">age of austerity was over.</a> Those interventions left Hammond with very little wriggle room but in truth are a sign of the government‚Äôs weakness. While Hammond boasted of the lowest unemployment since the 1970s, there was no mention of the worrying trends of recent years: flat-lining productivity, persistently weak investment, wages lower than they were a decade ago once inflation is taken into account.</p> <p>May has come to the conclusion that the public is sick of austerity, so Hammond‚Äôs unenviable task was to make it look as though everything bad that has happened over the past eight years was Labour‚Äôs fault.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for¬†Business¬†Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The chancellor made the best of a bad job and even managed a bit of push back to show that the Treasury was still committed to fiscal rectitude. Extra money for universal credit, repairing potholes and for schools can‚Äôt disguise the fact that austerity hasn‚Äôt come to an end. The Resolution Foundation thinktank calculates that the budgets of non-protected departments will be 3% lower in per capita terms in 2023 than in 2019. The freeze in working-age benefits for next year is still going ahead, saving ¬£1.5bn.</p> <p>The OBR‚Äôs bottom line is that the budget means an extra ¬£1.1bn this year, ¬£10.9bn next year and ¬£23.2bn by 2023-24. No chancellor ‚Äì not even George Osborne ‚Äì in the run-up to the 2015 election ‚Äì has been so generous since the fiscal watchdog was set up in 2010.</p> <p>Hammond‚Äôs attempts to show that his generosity was grounded in fiscal discipline cuts little ice with the OBR. It noted sniffily that the budget had the ‚Äúfamiliar Augustinian pattern of a near-term giveaway followed by a longer-term takeway‚Äù. St Augustine, it might be remembered, was famous for saying: ‚ÄúLord make me chaste, but not yet.‚Äù</p>",

                    "bodyText": "Watching Philip Hammond deliver his third budget, it was hard to avoid thinking that an election must be in the offing. Chancellors normally show their mean streak when parliaments are young and squirrel away any available cash so that they can give money away as polling day approaches. Not this time, though. The chancellor was in the position of knowing that public borrowing this year is on course to be ¬£12bn lower than was predicted in the spring ‚Äì an extremely happy outcome given the economy‚Äôs mediocre performance. Less than 18 months into the current parliament, Hammond could have saved his windfall and met his stated aim of balancing the budget by the middle of the next decade. Instead he decided to blow the lot ‚Äì in higher spending and an unexpected income tax cut. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) says the UK will still be in the red by 2023-24, although in reality a great deal depends on the sort of Brexit deal the government secures. Hammond expressed cheerful optimism about the double deal bonus he would get in the event that negotiations end successfully: the end of the uncertainty that has led firms to mothball investment plans will lead to stronger growth, and there will be no need to keep money aside for a no-deal outcome. Even so, the chancellor had to accept that he might be back with another package of measures in the spring if talks between London and Brussels break down over the coming months. In those circumstances, there will be pressure for a significant loosening of fiscal policy and all talk of balancing the budget by the middle of the next decade will go out of the window. The budget was unashamedly political both in its tone and its content. Hammond used every opportunity to take a swing at Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell on the Labour benches and took delight in announcing that there would be no more PFI projects on his watch. There could be only three possible explanations for Hammond‚Äôs approach. One is that he has overnight morphed into a born-again Keynesian and has decided that a bit more growth is the way to lick the public finances back into shape. That seems unlikely. A second is that the government secretly believes it is heading for a no-deal Brexit, so is giving the economy some padding before expected disruption during 2019. But if that were the case, Hammond would be keeping every bit of ammunition in reserve, not spending it now, so that does not seem all that probable either. That leaves the third and final explanation, which is that the real architect of this budget was Theresa May ‚Äì not Hammond. As the chancellor rather ruefully said, it was the prime minister who announced an extra ¬£84bn over five years for the NHS back in the summer, thus depriving him of a rabbit to pull out of the hat. What‚Äôs more, May then went further in her party conference speech and said that the public needed to know that the age of austerity was over. Those interventions left Hammond with very little wriggle room but in truth are a sign of the government‚Äôs weakness. While Hammond boasted of the lowest unemployment since the 1970s, there was no mention of the worrying trends of recent years: flat-lining productivity, persistently weak investment, wages lower than they were a decade ago once inflation is taken into account. May has come to the conclusion that the public is sick of austerity, so Hammond‚Äôs unenviable task was to make it look as though everything bad that has happened over the past eight years was Labour‚Äôs fault. The chancellor made the best of a bad job and even managed a bit of push back to show that the Treasury was still committed to fiscal rectitude. Extra money for universal credit, repairing potholes and for schools can‚Äôt disguise the fact that austerity hasn‚Äôt come to an end. The Resolution Foundation thinktank calculates that the budgets of non-protected departments will be 3% lower in per capita terms in 2023 than in 2019. The freeze in working-age benefits for next year is still going ahead, saving ¬£1.5bn. The OBR‚Äôs bottom line is that the budget means an extra ¬£1.1bn this year, ¬£10.9bn next year and ¬£23.2bn by 2023-24. No chancellor ‚Äì not even George Osborne ‚Äì in the run-up to the 2015 election ‚Äì has been so generous since the fiscal watchdog was set up in 2010. Hammond‚Äôs attempts to show that his generosity was grounded in fiscal discipline cuts little ice with the OBR. It noted sniffily that the budget had the ‚Äúfamiliar Augustinian pattern of a near-term giveaway followed by a longer-term takeway‚Äù. St Augustine, it might be remembered, was famous for saying: ‚ÄúLord make me chaste, but not yet.‚Äù",

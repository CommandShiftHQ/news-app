On to some football and here’s Ed Aarons on Maurico Pochettino’s sense of discontentment. Been a funny start to the season for them, hasn’t it? As mentioned in the piece, their league form is fine – but only a few weeks ago we were worrying about them losing games hand over fist and being in a mini crisis. The Champions League campaign has certainly been unsatisfactory so far, and Pochettino’s biggest annoyance is clearly that the stadium business hasn’t been put to bed – thus continuing to weigh Spurs down. They’re churning results out without quite looking at their best at the moment. Can tonight bring the kind of season-defining performance that might cheer their manager up? “As a Spurs supporter, I don’t ever wish to lose points but beating City on this lame excuse of a pitch would make me embarrassed, not elated with joy. A draw would be best,” writes Kaushik Prasad. Whooooaaaa! Does everything in this ultra-serious Premier League of ours really have to be gleamingly splendrous all the time? I do take the indirect point that Spurs’ stadium situation has gone/is going very badly and that this is an unfortunate consequence of that. I’ll talk about some actual football in a bit but look what we did for you back in 2016! A Joy of Six: Sporting Pitch Fiascos! Will tonight make seven? Interesting snippet from the wires, reporting that the match officials have been doing their due diligence on the surface: Parts of the pitch are lush and green, but there are large areas of worn brown turf, especially on each touchline, while the NFL logo is still visible in the centre circle. Referee Kevin Friend and his fellow match officials walked around the pitch at around 6pm with a ball testing to see how it rolls. “Wembley has come a long way from 1970 when domesticated equines tore up the pitch before the FA Cup final with the Horse of the Year Show,” notes Justin Kavanagh. “These days its Jaguars from Jacksonville and Philadelphian Eagles ruining the footie! Mind you, the Jaguars seemed to be only interested in prowling London’s nightclubs (running up a bar bill of $64,000, according to a Philly news report) and the droppings of eagles don’t seem too big a problem at Selhurst Park.” Tottenham Hotspur: Lloris, Trippier, Sanchez, Alderweireld, Davies, Dier, Dembele,Sissoko, Lamela, Lucas Moura, Kane. Subs: Son, Winks, Walker-Peters, Alli, Gazzaniga, Eriksen, Aurier. Man City: Ederson, Walker, Stones, Laporte, Mendy, Bernardo Silva, Fernandinho, Silva, Mahrez, Aguero, Sterling. Subs: Kompany, De Bruyne, Sane, Otamendi, Gabriel Jesus, Foden, Muric. Referee: Kevin Friend That’s interesting – Christian Eriksen and Kevin De Bruyne are both on the bench. Both have had their injury troubles. Is that a reaction from both managers to the pitch issue? Either way, it’s potentially a shame for the spectacle. “Faded American football stripes on a torn-up Wembley turf for a Premier League match?” observes Peter Oh. “Oh the irony! Or should I say, the gridirony?” The pitch doesn’t look great, does it, and the NFL logo in the middle tells a few stories. I have a question though. It’s not exactly going to be a quagmire, and 20 years ago nobody would have batted an eyelid – why aren’t things simply allowed to be a bit rubbish anymore? A Premier League weekend that has, for obvious reasons, been very difficult comes to an end tonight with a fixture that promises plenty of flourishes on the pitch. In fact it’s funny I mentioned the pitch, isn’t it, because that’s stolen many of the headlines before Tottenham’s keenly awaited match against Manchester City. Wembley’s surface has come off decidedly second-best to yesterdays NFL game and hands are being wrung about just how technical Mauricio Pochettino and Pep Guardiola’s men will be able to get tonight. Are you wringing yours? Does this sort of thing actually worry you? Either way it’s added another storyline to a match that doesn’t really need much setting up: if Tottenham, who often do pretty well against Man City, can do something here then you sense we really do have a title race this year. If City cut loose, as they did here in April, you wonder whether they’re purring towards top gear and ready to pull away again. They’ll go top on goal difference if they win; should Spurs take the points, though, City will drop to fourth and the hosts will go third. Plenty to get our teeth into then. Send me your tweets and emails – should be able to get through a fair few before kick-off, which is at 8pm UK time. Not midnight, even if it feels like that since the clocks went back.",

                    "bodyText": "Vices including online gambling, smoking cigarettes and drinking wine or champagne will be hit by increased “sin” taxes, but lovers of beer and spirits escaped with an unexpected duty freeze in Philip Hammond’s budget. The shake-up means: A bottle of wine goes up by 7p, sparkling wine by 10p. Average pack of 20 cigarettes to rise above £10. Online gambling hit by £1bn taxes over five years. The government’s decision earlier this year to cut the maximum stake on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) from £100 to £2 triggered an overhaul of gambling tax, due to take effect in October. Lost revenue from the machine gaming duty levied on FOBTs is expected to cost the exchequer £1.15bn over five years, according to Treasury projections. It will make up for the shortfall by increasing the tax on online casino games from 15% to 21%, raising an estimated £1.25bn over the same period. While the tweaks to gambling tax will cancel each other out fiscally, both FOBT campaigners and online gambling companies are likely to be unhappy. Campaigners against FOBTs, who say they are highly addictive, criticised the decision to postpone FOBT curbs until October last year, as revealed by the Guardian last week. Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, said: “By rolling back on their promises the government are allowing greed to triumph over good as the bookies trouser an additional £900m in revenue. “The new secretary of state has let down not only his predecessors who campaigned for urgent change, but all the gambling charities, reformers and addicts who were relying on him not to bow to the will of the Treasury.” The chancellor surprised the beer and pubs industry by cancelling duty hikes on beer and spirits, which were expected to see a 3.4% rise in line with inflation, but wine duty will continue to rise. Jackie Parker, the national chairman of real ale enthusiasts’ group Camra, said the freeze would “no doubt go some way to keeping the British pub-going tradition affordable”. The Wine and Spirit Trade Association said distillers would welcome the cancellation of a rise in spirits duty but said winemakers would be hit with an extra £90m bill. “It actively undermines a sector that has been hardest hit since the Brexit referendum and will be thoroughly unwelcome for the 33 million consumers of the nation’s most popular alcoholic drink,” said the association’s chief executive, Miles Beale. The tobacco escalator, under which tax on cigarettes goes up by inflation plus 2% each year, will continue, meaning the average cost of a packet of 20 cigarettes will rise above £10 for the first time.",

The England and Wales Cricket Board is continuing with its preparations for the series as planned but said: “We are aware of the developments and are in constant contact with the British High Commission. We are exercising vigilance and avoiding all demonstrations or large political gatherings.”",

                    "bodyText": "Universal credit is here to stay, Philip Hammond has said, as he announced extra investment in the flagship benefit aimed at making it more generous to some low-income working claimants. By injecting £1.7bn into work allowances, the chancellor reversed much of the cut to universal credit made by his predecessor, George Osborne, in 2015 and suggested ministers were fully committed to the much-delayed benefits overhaul programme. Hammond’s cash-for-work allowances may be enough to head off a threatened revolt by Conservative backbenchers concerned that some low-income working families on tax credits would be £200 a month worse off after moving to universal credit. “Universal credit is here to stay and we are putting in the funding needed to make it a success,” Hammond told the Commons. He said it was a “long overdue and necessary reform” of the benefits system that would help drive jobs and growth. Hammond also announced an extra £1bn over five years to provide extra protection for people on tax credits and other benefits who would be moved over to universal credit in the next few years. Details will be announced this year. There will be “run-on” support from 2020, whereby unemployed claimants will continue to receive existing benefits for two weeks after submitting their universal credit application, in a move aimed at easing the long waiting time for a first payment. Universal credit rolls together six working-age benefits into a single monthly payment, including jobseeker’s allowance, working tax credits and housing benefits. Work allowances are the amount claimants can earn before benefits start to be withdrawn. Higher work allowances in theory encourage claimants to move into work, or work longer hours. The Resolution Foundation thinktank welcomed the work allowance boost, saying the £1,000 threshold increase would deliver a £630 boost to low-income families, meaning universal credit was now more generous than the benefit system it was replacing. Torsten Bell, the Resolution Foundation chief executive, said: “While today’s reforms certainly won’t end all the problems some recipients have faced with universal credit, they should ease the rollout in the months and years ahead.” However, opposition politicians and charities emphasised ministers had not addressed wider cuts to welfare or structural problems with universal credit, such as the long waiting times for payment that forced some families into debt or to rely on food banks. John McDonnell, Labour’s shadow chancellor, said: “The money promised for universal credit is less than a third of the £7bn of social security cuts still to come and today’s announcement on work allowances reverses just over half the cuts made in 2015.” Matthew Reed, the chief executive at the Children’s Society, said: “While the government has taken some important steps in the right direction it has still not done enough to address serious problems with universal credit which are causing hardship for many families.” Alison Garnham, the chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, said: “The work allowance increase is unequivocally good news for families receiving universal credit but a bigger salvage operation is still needed for the benefit.” Hammond’s striking endorsement of universal credit comes after criticism from two previous prime ministers, Sir John Major and Gordon Brown, who said the changes could trigger poll tax-levels of public unpopularity. Labour has called for universal credit to be halted and fixed before the next stage of its rollout, which will lead to 2 million claimants on tax credits and employment and support allowance migrate on to the new system during the next three years. The chancellor has also been under intense pressure from Conservative backbenchers and poverty campaigners to restore the level of work allowances, seen by many as essential if universal credit is to uphold its original aims of incentivising work. Hammond pointedly paid tribute to the political architect of universal credit, the former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith, now a backbench MP, “without whose tenacity universal credit would never have seen the light”. Duncan Smith oversaw the introduction of universal credit in the face of opposition from Osborne and a series of implementation disasters. He resigned from the cabinet in 2016 in part over cuts to work allowances the previous autumn. The chancellor’s announcement on work allowances was welcomed by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which called it “an important step forward” in tackling the rise of in-work poverty that it said would help ease the burden for low-income families.",

While Hammond boasted of the lowest unemployment since the 1970s, there was no mention of the worrying trends of recent years: flat-lining productivity, persistently weak investment, wages lower than they were a decade ago once inflation is taken into account.</p> <p>May has come to the conclusion that the public is sick of austerity, so Hammond’s unenviable task was to make it look as though everything bad that has happened over the past eight years was Labour’s fault.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The chancellor made the best of a bad job and even managed a bit of push back to show that the Treasury was still committed to fiscal rectitude. Extra money for universal credit, repairing potholes and for schools can’t disguise the fact that austerity hasn’t come to an end. The Resolution Foundation thinktank calculates that the budgets of non-protected departments will be 3% lower in per capita terms in 2023 than in 2019. The freeze in working-age benefits for next year is still going ahead, saving £1.5bn.</p> <p>The OBR’s bottom line is that the budget means an extra £1.1bn this year, £10.9bn next year and £23.2bn by 2023-24. No chancellor – not even George Osborne – in the run-up to the 2015 election – has been so generous since the fiscal watchdog was set up in 2010.</p> <p>Hammond’s attempts to show that his generosity was grounded in fiscal discipline cuts little ice with the OBR. It noted sniffily that the budget had the “familiar Augustinian pattern of a near-term giveaway followed by a longer-term takeway”. St Augustine, it might be remembered, was famous for saying: “Lord make me chaste, but not yet.”</p>",

As the chancellor rather ruefully said, it was the prime minister who announced an extra £84bn over five years for the NHS back in the summer, thus depriving him of a rabbit to pull out of the hat. What’s more, May then went further in her party conference speech and said that the public needed to know that the age of austerity was over. Those interventions left Hammond with very little wriggle room but in truth are a sign of the government’s weakness. While Hammond boasted of the lowest unemployment since the 1970s, there was no mention of the worrying trends of recent years: flat-lining productivity, persistently weak investment, wages lower than they were a decade ago once inflation is taken into account. May has come to the conclusion that the public is sick of austerity, so Hammond’s unenviable task was to make it look as though everything bad that has happened over the past eight years was Labour’s fault. The chancellor made the best of a bad job and even managed a bit of push back to show that the Treasury was still committed to fiscal rectitude. Extra money for universal credit, repairing potholes and for schools can’t disguise the fact that austerity hasn’t come to an end. The Resolution Foundation thinktank calculates that the budgets of non-protected departments will be 3% lower in per capita terms in 2023 than in 2019. The freeze in working-age benefits for next year is still going ahead, saving £1.5bn. The OBR’s bottom line is that the budget means an extra £1.1bn this year, £10.9bn next year and £23.2bn by 2023-24. No chancellor – not even George Osborne – in the run-up to the 2015 election – has been so generous since the fiscal watchdog was set up in 2010. Hammond’s attempts to show that his generosity was grounded in fiscal discipline cuts little ice with the OBR. It noted sniffily that the budget had the “familiar Augustinian pattern of a near-term giveaway followed by a longer-term takeway”. St Augustine, it might be remembered, was famous for saying: “Lord make me chaste, but not yet.”",

                    "bodyText": "Belfast landed a big budget boost, with £350m pledged as part of regional city deals announced by the chancellor. Philip Hammond also pledged £320m to the Northern Ireland executive along with £2m cash to help Belfast city centre recover from the fire that engulfed the historic Primark building recently. While the £350m is lower than the £450m Belfast had requested, it could be enough to secure other funding, said Esmond Birnie, a senior economist at Ulster University Business School. “Although the amount is lower [than expected], this could be enough to secure backing elsewhere,” he said. City regional deals are designed to help economies around the UK and have been embraced by the Scottish government, which got a £150m lift from the chancellor for its Tay city regional deal, which covers the council areas of Angus, Dundee, Fife and Perth &amp; Kinross. Aodhán Connolly, the director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said while Belfast did not get what it wanted, it represented a greater per capita spend for the local population than in other city deals. The Belfast money, which will be spread over 10 years, will focus on the creation of centres of innovation, digital connectivity, tourism and transport. The Northern Irish city and wider economy has received a significant boost from the opening of the Titanic Belfast centre in 2012. Hammond also announced he would be increasing funding to the transforming cities fund, with an additional £9m to trial new models of transport and £15m for digital investment in the north-east, Northern Ireland, and the south-east. Manchester got £10m for a new pilot scheme to support the self-employed, while there was £37m extra given to the Northern Powerhouse rail project.",
